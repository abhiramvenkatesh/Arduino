This project is based on concepts of IOT. In this project we control the movement of the bot by connecting the esp32 to the controller via mosquitto server through wifi medium. \
In this project we have utilized python program to read the input data from the controller which is then fed to the server.
At the processor side we have used esp32 to recieve the signal.\
The esp32 at the hardware part is connected to the mosquitto server and the recieved signals are then processed using Arduino codes.
